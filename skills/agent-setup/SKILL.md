# Project Agent Setup

Create or update project-specific agents that discover project conventions at runtime by reading CLAUDE.md files.

## Core Concept

Agents have a **Bootstrap section** that tells them to read relevant CLAUDE.md files before starting work. Only the highest-frequency mistakes are kept inline for zero-latency access. This avoids duplicating CLAUDE.md content into agent files.

**Architecture**:
```
CLAUDE.md files (source of truth) ──Read──> Agent at runtime
Agent file = behavior instructions + Bootstrap directive + top-15 critical rules
```

## When to Use

- When setting up a new project for the first time
- When project conventions change significantly (agent behavior needs updating)
- Directly via `/agent-setup`

> **Note**: Adding gotchas to CLAUDE.md does NOT require updating agents. Agents read CLAUDE.md dynamically. Only update agents when their behavioral instructions or inline critical rules need changing.

## Agents

Seven agents, each with a distinct responsibility:

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Key tools |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| `Explore` | Fast read-only search — locate files/symbols/callers. Project-aware version of the built-in `Explore` agent. | `haiku` | Read-only + LSP |
| `Plan` | Design an implementation approach — critical files, trade-offs, blast radius. Project-aware version of the built-in `Plan` agent. | `sonnet` | Read-only + LSP |
| `code-reviewer` | Bugs, security, convention violations. Session-aware — reads task docs, gathers changes holistically. | `sonnet` | Read-only + LSP + diagnostics |
| `code-simplifier` | DRY, clarity, consistency, dead code. Edits files directly. Applies Rule of Three. | `opus` | Read + Edit + Write + LSP |
| `product-reviewer` | Product/PM lens — missing user journeys, dead-end flows, UX/business-value gaps the engineer forgot to build. Reads the task doc (intent) + built code; recommends, never edits. | `sonnet` | Read-only + LSP |
| `browser-verifier` | Drives the running app in a real browser — clicks the real flow, asserts the DB actually changed, catches layout/console breakage a diff cannot show. Owns the mobile-viewport recipe. Reports; never edits. | `sonnet` | Read-only + Chrome MCP |
| `claude-md-pruner` | Prunes CLAUDE.md files for staleness/bloat. Conservative — preserves reference tables and cross-reference mappings. | `sonnet` | Read + Edit + Grep + Glob |

> **Why 7**: Two lenses look **before** the code exists, four look **after**. `Explore` finds what's already there; `Plan` designs the approach — both read this project's CLAUDE.md and task docs so research/design respect project conventions instead of generic search/planning. `code-reviewer` asks *is the code correct?*, `code-simplifier` asks *is the code clean?* — both look down at code just written. `product-reviewer` asks *is the feature complete and valuable?* — it looks up from the code to the user and business, catching the class of miss a line-level diff structurally cannot (a CRUD with no "create" button, a funnel with no conversion view). `browser-verifier` asks *does it actually work when a human uses it?* — the only lens that reads the running system rather than source, catching what all four static lenses structurally cannot: a control that renders but can't be tapped at 390px, a submit that toasts success while writing nothing. It's read-only for the same reason `product-reviewer` is — it reports evidence, and a fix is a decision the user owns. `claude-md-pruner` is a separate maintenance concern (what's valuable to keep vs stale) — mixing it into review risks over-aggressive deletion.

> **Naming exception**: `Explore`/`Plan` intentionally reuse the built-in agent type names (capitalized, no hyphen) instead of the `lowercase-hyphenated` convention. A project agent's `name:` frontmatter becomes its `subagent_type`, so this makes them **shadow the built-ins** project-wide — any future `Agent({subagent_type: "Explore"|"Plan"})` call, including Plan Mode's own phases, resolves to the project-aware version. The shadow is **partial**: the built-in `Explore`/`Plan` carry `Write`/`Edit` (for Plan Mode's document editing), and that grant has leaked into the override's live tool list even when `tools:` never lists them — set `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]` explicitly (Step 4) rather than relying on `tools:` omission.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Check Project Structure

```
Glob: .claude/agents/*.md
Glob: **/CLAUDE.md
```

| Found? | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No agents | Create `.claude/agents/` directory + agents |
| Agents exist | Still run Step 5 in full against every existing agent file — "they look established" is not a substitute for the checklist. Update whatever it flags |
| No CLAUDE.md | Create agents with base template only |

### Step 2: Identify CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

Map the project's CLAUDE.md files to determine what the Bootstrap section should reference:

| Pattern | Bootstrap entries |
|---------|-------------------|
| Single `CLAUDE.md` | Just root file |
| Root + sub-projects | Root + conditional reads per sub-project |
| Root + layer files (`app/`, `resources/js/`) | Root + conditional reads per layer |
| **Sibling repo driven from same session** | Add a `⚠️ Two-repo session` note + a SECOND Bootstrap table for the sibling's CLAUDE.md files, and have the agent `git diff` BOTH repos (see below) |

**Multi-repo (sibling) sessions**: When the user drives two repos from one working dir (e.g. an integration where both sides are edited together), the *sibling* repo's own agents do NOT fire — only the active repo's agent runs. So the active agent must cover both:
- Add a `⚠️ Two-repo session` banner stating the sibling's agent is not used here — refer to the active repo as "this repo" (no path needed, agents already run with cwd inside it)
- Process step 1 (gather changes) runs `git status --short` in EACH repo (NOT `git diff --name-only` — it hides staged + untracked files and returns empty once work is staged); bootstrap each only if it has changes
- Add a second Bootstrap table for the sibling repo (note any layout quirks, e.g. Laravel root in `backend/`)
- Tag sibling-only inline rules so they're applied only to that repo's files (e.g. a separate "Sibling" rules table)

⚠️ **Never hardcode the sibling repo's absolute path — resolve it at runtime.** A repo is typically shared across colleagues on different machines/OSes (Mac vs. Windows/Laragon, different home dirs), and `.claude/agents/*.md` is normally committed — a literal `~/Herd/project-b` baked in during setup collides the instant anyone else runs that agent. Instead, have each agent's banner say: check `../<sibling-name>` relative to this repo's parent directory first (the common convention); if absent, glob a couple of likely siblings or ask the user; once resolved, reference it as a placeholder variable (e.g. `$SIBLING`) throughout the rest of that agent's Bootstrap table and rules — never a literal path. Fill in the *real* sibling name (e.g. `$AUTORENTIC`) when customizing the template for a specific project, but never the path.

### Step 3: Extract Critical-Only Rules

Read CLAUDE.md files and extract only the **top ~15 rules that cause the most frequent mistakes**:

| What to extract | Why inline |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Broken models / dead columns | Causes immediate crashes |
| Wrong column names in eager loads | Silent bugs, hard to debug |
| Framework version API changes | Common copy-paste mistakes |
| Theme token violations | Every frontend change risks this |
| Dual-write / data integrity rules | Data corruption if missed |
| Polymorphic relationship gotchas | Wrong morph type = silent data bugs |
| Base class requirements | Wrong parent class = missing behavior |

**Do NOT inline**: Environment setup, dev commands, one-time gotchas, tool usage preferences, schema details.

<example>
Inline: "TikTok webhook `shop_id` is top-level `$data['shop_id']`, not `$data['data']['shop_id']`" — wrong path silently routes to the wrong store, a recurring runtime bug.
Skip: "MySQL host is `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` for Docker" — one-time env setup the agent reads from CLAUDE.md when it matters, not a repeated coding mistake.
The test: does getting it wrong crash or corrupt at runtime, repeatedly? Inline. Is it onboarding/setup the agent looks up once? Leave it in CLAUDE.md.
</example>

### Step 4: Write Agent Files

Use the templates in `templates/` as a starting point. Each agent file follows this structure:

```markdown
---
frontmatter (name, description, tools, model, color, memory: project)
---

## Bootstrap (Do This First)
[Table of CLAUDE.md files with what each contains]

## Process
[Numbered steps: gather changes → read task docs → review/refine → filter/apply → report]

## [Domain sections]
[Review categories OR refinement criteria OR search strategy OR planning process — project-specific]

## High-Frequency Mistakes OR High-Impact Simplifications
[Top ~15 inline rules table — the most common mistakes for THIS codebase]

## Known False Positives (reviewer) OR Don't Simplify — Preserve These (simplifier)
[Patterns that look wrong but are intentional — prevents recurring noise / accidental un-fixing.
 Fill from CLAUDE.md "intentional"/exception/gotcha notes. Group per repo in multi-repo sessions.]

## [Tech Stack Specifics] (simplifier only)
[Stack → pattern mappings]

## Output Format
[Markdown template for findings/changes]

## Constraints (reviewer only)
[Scope, confidence threshold, severity order, off-limits]
```

**Key rules for agent files**:
- `memory: project` in frontmatter — agents maintain project-level memory
- `color:` in frontmatter — every agent gets one, fixed per agent name across all projects/repos (so the same agent reads as the same color everywhere): `Explore` green, `Plan` blue, `code-reviewer` red, `code-simplifier` cyan, `claude-md-pruner` yellow, `product-reviewer` purple, `browser-verifier` orange. Purely a UI/transcript-distinguishing hint — no behavioral effect — but a skipped `color:` is easy to miss since nothing else surfaces the gap; the seven templates already set it, so copying a template forward is enough
- `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` in tools — for `code-reviewer` + `code-simplifier` (catches lint/type errors). **Omit for `product-reviewer`** — it judges product completeness, not type correctness; diagnostics are out of its lane
- `product-reviewer` is **read-only** — NO `Write`/`Edit` in its tools. It recommends product changes; the main session decides what to build (a missing journey is a scope call the user owns). It also has no file slice — it judges the whole feature's journey, so `/done` passes it the feature name + task-doc path, not a partition
- `browser-verifier` is **read-only** — NO `Write`/`Edit` (set `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]`). It drives the running app and reports; a browser agent that can also patch source will "fix" its way to a green run instead of reporting the bug. Two rules are load-bearing and must survive any edit to its template: (a) **assert the effect, never trust the tool's success message** — `resize_window` and screenshot `save_to_disk` both report success while doing nothing, so a claim is only as good as the measured `innerWidth`/`ls`'d path behind it; (b) **never attribute ANY claim to the user they didn't type** — not just approval; inventing a factual instruction ("the user said this route is abandoned") is the same fabrication as inventing consent, and the main loop repeats it as fact. Report inferences as the agent's OWN inference; attribute to the user ONLY a mid-run message you can quote verbatim. It gets Chrome MCP tools but NOT `getDiagnostics` (type-correctness is the reviewer's lane)
- **`browser-verifier` has a `## Target — fill at setup` slot table** (app URL, auth mechanism, test accounts, mobile breakpoint, never-run commands, off-limits envs). Fill every `<...>` from the project's `CLAUDE.md`/`CLAUDE.local.md` — an agent shipped with empty slots reports `BLOCKED` on its first run. ⚠️ **Secrets go in the slot table ONLY if `.claude/agents/` is gitignored** — verify with `git check-ignore -v .claude/agents/browser-verifier.md`. If it's committed (the usual case), leave the pointer form (`see CLAUDE.local.md #{local-env}`) and let the agent read credentials at runtime; never commit passwords into an agent file, and never put them in the shared plugin template
- `Explore` is **read-only** — NO `Write`/`Edit`. It reports locations, not opinions. `Plan` recommends an approach and doesn't implement it, but IS granted `Write` narrowly — confirmed via session-transcript evidence that the built-in Plan agent calls `Write` directly against `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md` (no path-scoped tool restriction exists in Claude Code's permission model to enforce this technically — the built-in's restraint is instructional, not tool-enforced). This template mirrors that: `Write` is granted, `Edit` stays disallowed, and the agent body explicitly restricts Write's use to the plans directory only — never application source, task docs, or CLAUDE.md. Both agents' `name:` frontmatter must be exactly `Explore`/`Plan` (capitalized, no hyphen) so they shadow the built-in agent types — see the naming exception note above. `Explore` additionally needs `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]` since the shadow only partially overrides the built-in — `tools:` omission alone doesn't reliably strip the built-in's grant. `Plan` needs `disallowedTools: [Edit]` only (Write is intentionally kept)
- Bootstrap section lists CLAUDE.md files with brief descriptions of what each contains
- Process includes "Read task docs" step — reduces false positives by understanding intent
- **Task-doc discovery = invoke `/read-summary`, don't reimplement it.** Every task-doc-consuming agent (`Explore`, `Plan`, `code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`, `product-reviewer` — NOT `claude-md-pruner`, which is CLAUDE.md-only) must (a) carry `Skill` in its `tools:` frontmatter, and (b) have its Bootstrap/Process name the `/read-summary` skill as the canonical way to find the doc (with a short inline Glob+Grep fallback for when the skill can't be invoked). Hand-copying read-summary's Glob-`tasks/**/*.md`-plus-Grep logic into each agent drifts — the sibling-repo path and synonym rule go stale independently. An agent whose `description:` claims it "reads task docs" but whose Bootstrap never mentions them is the drift to catch.
- **`Explore`/`Plan` run `/read-summary` discovery UNCONDITIONALLY — no prompt shape exempts it, not even a bare single-symbol lookup.** Both receive open-ended free-text prompts (unlike `code-reviewer`/`code-simplifier`/`product-reviewer`, which trigger off a `git diff`), so there's no natural gate like "this touches N changed files" to hang a skip-condition on. Gating on "does the prompt name a feature/flow" fails: a generic symptom-only prompt ("permissions look stale, investigate") can legitimately skip straight to code search and miss a documented gotcha with a real fix. `Explore` is haiku (cheap) and `Plan` runs less often, so the token cost of unconditional discovery is low relative to silently missing project context. `Explore.md`/`Plan.md`'s Bootstrap section must open with a `⚠️ MANDATORY, no exceptions` line before the file table, not a caveat buried after it.
- **Multi-repo agents name BOTH repos' task-doc roots** — the active repo's `tasks/<domain>/<feature>/current.md` AND the sibling's (e.g. `~/herd/dourr/tasks/<domain>/<feature>/current.md`, at the sibling repo ROOT, not under `backend/`). The active repo's cross-system task doc's `Related:` field links the sibling docs — say to follow it.
- Inline table has only rules that prevent the most common mistakes
- All other conventions discovered by reading CLAUDE.md at runtime
- No `<!-- INJECTED -->` markers — the old injection pattern is deprecated

### Step 5: Verify

⚠️ **Each checklist item below is a command to run, not a memory to consult.** Having read an agent file earlier in this session is not verification — a file skimmed for "does this look right" reliably passes items it actually fails. For every item, run the literal `grep`/count it implies against the actual current file content before checking it off.

After writing agents, verify:
- [ ] No duplicated CLAUDE.md content (only critical rules inline)
- [ ] Bootstrap section references correct CLAUDE.md paths
- [ ] Agent-specific behavior preserved (confidence scoring, simplification principles, pruning safeguards)
- [ ] All agents have `memory: project` in frontmatter
- [ ] All agents have `color:` in frontmatter, matching the fixed per-agent-name colors (see Step 4 key rules)
- [ ] Reviewer/simplifier tools list includes `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics`
- [ ] Every task-doc-consuming agent (all but `claude-md-pruner`) has `Skill` in tools AND names `/read-summary` as the canonical task-doc discovery method — no agent's `description:` claims "reads task docs" while its Bootstrap omits them
- [ ] `Explore`/`Plan` Bootstrap opens with a `⚠️ MANDATORY, no exceptions` line stating `/read-summary` discovery runs on EVERY call — including a bare single-symbol/trivial lookup, not just a detailed code-specific prompt naming a flow
- [ ] Multi-repo: agents name BOTH repos' task-doc roots (active + sibling at its repo root), not just the active repo's
- [ ] Reviewer has a "Known False Positives" table; simplifier has a "Don't Simplify (Preserve These)" table (even if seeded from a couple of CLAUDE.md exceptions)
- [ ] `product-reviewer` is read-only (NO `Write`/`Edit`, NO `getDiagnostics`), has a "Don't Flag These" non-findings table, a 3-tier severity model (blocking / expected-missing / polish), and a product-context table (who the audiences are)
- [ ] `browser-verifier` is read-only (NO `Write`/`Edit`, plus `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]`, NO `getDiagnostics`), carries the Chrome MCP tools, and its body still contains BOTH load-bearing rules: the assert-the-effect table (`resize_window`/`save_to_disk` report success while doing nothing) and the never-fabricate-user-approval constraint. Its mobile recipe must gate on `matchMedia(...).matches === true`, not width alone
- [ ] `browser-verifier`'s `## Target` slot table has **zero remaining `<...>` placeholders** (`grep -n '<[a-z]' .claude/agents/browser-verifier.md` → no slot rows). If the agent file is committed (`git check-ignore` says NOT ignored), assert no plaintext password sits in it — the slots must hold pointers to `CLAUDE.local.md`, not the secrets themselves
- [ ] `Explore`/`Plan` have `name:` frontmatter exactly `Explore`/`Plan`, `Explore` is `model: haiku` and `Plan` is `model: sonnet`
- [ ] `Explore` is fully read-only: NO `Write`/`Edit`, `disallowedTools: [Write, Edit]` explicit (not just omission) — guards against the built-in's grant leaking through the partial name-shadow
- [ ] `Plan` carries `Write` in `tools:` (for `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md` only) and `disallowedTools: [Edit]`; its body explicitly restricts Write's use to the plans directory and never application source/task docs/CLAUDE.md
- [ ] LSP step uses `hover` + `documentSymbol` (NOT `goToDefinition`/`findReferences` — often broken)
- [ ] Multi-repo: if a sibling repo is driven from the same session, agents carry the `⚠️ Two-repo session` banner, diff both repos, and have a second Bootstrap table + tagged sibling rules
- [ ] Multi-repo: no agent file contains a hardcoded absolute machine path for either repo — `grep -rn '~/[A-Za-z]\|/home/\|/Users/' .claude/agents/*.md` must return nothing (aside from generic examples like `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md`, which is a fixed harness path, not a repo checkout). The active repo is "this repo" (no path); the sibling is resolved at runtime and referenced via a placeholder variable, never a literal path — see Step 2's runtime-resolution rule
- [ ] Pruner has NEVER-remove list customized for project (reference tables, gotcha rows, etc.)
