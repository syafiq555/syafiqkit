## Bootstrap

Read these files first to understand the project's CLAUDE.md conventions:

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § CLAUDE.md Maintenance | Authoritative pruning rules, gotcha condensation criteria |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Root project conventions — the source of truth |
<!-- Add rows for each CLAUDE.md in the hierarchy:
| `backend/CLAUDE.md` | Backend-specific conventions |
| `frontend/CLAUDE.md` | Frontend-specific conventions |
-->

## Philosophy

CLAUDE.md files are **living constraint documents**, not changelogs. Every line must earn its place by preventing a future mistake. But "preventing mistakes" includes **saving lookup time** — a cross-reference table that combines info from 3 files into one scannable view is valuable even if each fact exists elsewhere.

The goal is to keep files **around ~200 lines** (350 is the hard ceiling past which Claude skims instead of reading) while **preserving everything that prevents incorrect code or unnecessary multi-file lookups**.

## Process

### 0. Target length (always applies, not just when the user names a number)

Default target is **~200 lines**; 350 is the outer ceiling. This applies whether or not the user gives an explicit number — "condense this" or silence both mean aim for ~200.

1. **First** — run the normal prune (steps 1-5 below). Report the result.
2. **If the pruned file is still over ~200 lines**: do NOT delete additional live/verified/non-duplicate content just to hit the number. Instead, check whether any section passes the **splitting seam-test** (from root `CLAUDE.md` § CLAUDE.md Maintenance): a section can move to a subdir/domain `CLAUDE.md` ONLY when its rules are both **needed there** AND **useless elsewhere**. Cross-cutting content (used by 3+ callers/domains) fails the test and must stay in the parent file even if that means missing the target. This split-over-cut preference is the default strategy, not conditional on the user asking for a specific number.
3. **Report honestly** if the target can't be hit without lossy cuts — name which sections would have to be cut and let the user decide, rather than silently deleting to satisfy the number.

### 1. Inventory

For each file path provided:
1. Read the file
2. Run `wc -l` to get current line count
3. Read root `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative reference

### 2. Classify each section

Walk through every section and classify each entry:

| Classification | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Active constraint** — prevents a concrete mistake | Keep |
| **Cross-reference table** — combines info from multiple sources | Keep |
| **Quick-reference mapping** — type→behavior, role→permission, etc. | Keep |
| **Gotcha with ✅ fix** — documents non-obvious behavior | Keep (the fix IS the constraint) |
| **One-time fix** — migration command, data patch, seeder fix | Delete or move to task doc |
| **Implementation doc** — explains how code works (not what to avoid) | Delete |
| **"Verified/working" note** — confirms something works | Delete |
| **Stale reference** — file paths that no longer exist, resolved incidents | Verify with Glob/Grep, delete if stale |
| **TODO/backlog item** — belongs in task doc or issue tracker | Move to task doc |
| **Duplicate** — same constraint exists in another CLAUDE.md | Delete the less-specific one |

### 3. Verify before deleting

Before removing ANY entry:

1. **Grep the codebase** for the entry's key terms — confirm the pattern/file/behavior still exists or has been resolved
2. **Ask the litmus question**: "Would removing this cause Claude to write incorrect code OR spend extra time looking up multiple files?" If yes to either → **keep it**
3. **Check for cross-references** — other CLAUDE.md files or task docs might reference this entry

### 4. Apply changes

- Use `Edit` tool (not `Write`) for surgical removals
- Never rewrite entire files — only remove/edit specific entries
- After edits, run `wc -l` and report before/after

### 5. Report

Output a table:

```
| File | Before | After | Removed | Kept (notable) |
|------|--------|-------|---------|-----------------|
```

For each removal, state what was removed and why. For anything borderline that was kept, briefly note why.

## What to NEVER remove

These are always valuable regardless of whether individual facts appear elsewhere:

- **Reference tables** that cross-reference multiple concepts (type→grading→difficulty, role→permissions, route→middleware)
- **Gotcha rows** with ✅ fixes — even "fixed" bugs document the constraint that prevents regression
- **❌/✅ convention pairs** — these are the most scannable form of guidance
- **Platform gotcha tables** (Symptom|Cause|Fix) — environment-specific traps are hard to rediscover
- **Cost/quota tables** — API limits, rate limits, pricing tiers
<!-- Add project-specific NEVER-remove items here:
- **[project-specific]** — description
-->

## Gotcha condensation (from global rules)

When a gotcha row is mature and well-understood, it can be **promoted** (not deleted):
- Symptom/Cause/Fix → ❌/✅ Critical Rule (drop symptom/cause, keep only the ✅ action)
- Only promote if the ✅ action is self-explanatory without the symptom context

Delete gotcha rows ONLY if:
- Marked with strikethrough
- Contains "Fixed:" referencing a specific commit/PR that resolved the root cause permanently
- Documents a one-time seeder/migration fix that can never recur
- Is an IDE-specific hint (belongs in editor config, not CLAUDE.md)
