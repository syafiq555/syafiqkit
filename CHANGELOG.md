# Changelog

## 1.37.1

- **agent-setup**: Reviewer and simplifier templates gained TypeScript type-discipline examples, added as `[TypeScript]`-tagged commented rows inside the existing placeholder blocks so `agent-setup` surfaces them only when scaffolding a TS project (never on PHP-only repos). Reviewer gets a Bugs-category entry for type-drift silent bugs (union-keyed map typed `Record<string, X>`, or a non-exhaustive `switch` on a discriminated union with no `const _:never` guard — the consumer misses new cases with no compile error) plus a High-Frequency Mistakes row for hand-listed types that duplicate an existing source instead of deriving. Simplifier gets matching High-Impact and Tech-Stack rows steering toward `keyof typeof` / `typeof arr[number]` / `ReturnType` / mapped types, `as const`, `satisfies`, and `unknown` over `any`.
- **md-to-pdf**: Documented the xychart-beta default-palette gotcha — pass `plotColorPalette` via `mmdc -c` since the default palette renders poorly.

## 1.37.0

- **task-summary**: Added the missing sentence-level density layer (Layer 2) — short declarative sentences, ≤1 parenthetical, commit hashes only in Last Session, no inline verification metrics, plus a capture filter ("would a future session act differently knowing this?"). Fixed two self-contradictions that structurally forced doc bloat: the "put the why in → see Last Session" pointer targeted a section that gets overwritten every session (so rationale migrated into permanent rows as 10-sentence paragraphs), and "never delete historical rows" conflicted with pruning (a 37-row Task Status table with 34 dead rows). Now: rationale gets condensed in place (no archive files — pairs with `read-summary` loading the full doc each session), finished work streams collapse to one summary row, Files is a living map not a per-phase changelog, Last Session is ONE session ≤5 bullets, and >300 lines triggers a mandatory condense pass. Templates gained bad-vs-good sentence examples. Exemplar: the Dourr ads doc went 333→189 lines with zero in-force decisions/gotchas lost.
- **done**: Auto **light mode** — sessions touching <5 files in a single domain (no new feature/architecture, no external inputs) get a single reviewer agent, a path-scoped `task-summary` call (skips the multi-domain scan), and a compact one-table output. Full pipeline stays the default. Output template collapsed from four sections to one table that details only what was written/fixed.
- **update-claude-docs**: Entry style rules (≤2 sentences, no session storytelling, one example max, capture filter) and a rewritten Violations rule — escalate by **position + sharpness, not length**: REPLACE the old text, never append a second warning; callouts cap at 3 lines; rules already bloated from past escalations get condensed while hardening the core constraint. Validate step scans for narrative markers and flags >350-line target files for the pruner. Root cause: "clear but violated = not prominent enough" was implemented as "write more words", which compounded the same rule into 15-line war-story paragraphs.

## 1.36.0

- **ci-ssh-deploy-timeout** (new skill): Diagnose + fix CI/CD deploys that intermittently fail when the runner can't SSH into the target server (`dial tcp ***:22: i/o timeout`, "works on the 2nd re-run"). The skill's spine is *diagnose before fix*: it names the three causes that look identical in a CI log (transient packet loss / real firewall / sshd throttling) and runs a read-only rule-out checklist (`nc` port reach, `ufw`, `fail2ban`, `MaxStartups` — via `remote <alias>` if configured, else plain `ssh`) BEFORE touching anything, specifically to kill the "just allowlist the GitHub runner IPs" reflex (a dead end — hosted-runner pools rotate). The fix is the connect-only retry pattern (`retry_on_exit_code: 255` so genuine remote failures still fail fast on attempt 1), with `references/github-actions.md` (nick-fields/retry + direct ssh, incl. the YAML-literal-block heredoc false-alarm note) and `references/generic-ssh.md` (portable bash retry loop for GitLab/CircleCI/Jenkins/Makefile). Captured from a Dourr prod-deploy session where the firewall theory was chased before being ruled out by evidence.

## 1.35.1

- **ship**: Added a **version-bump gate** to Step 2 (Commit) — plugin/package repos must bump EVERY file carrying the version, not just the primary. `grep -rn '"version"' <manifest-dir>` discovers secondary fields (`marketplace.json` `plugins[0].version`, monorepo sub-manifests) that drift silently when only one is bumped. The bump rule lived in `CLAUDE.md#version-bumping` but the ship workflow that triggers a bump never referenced it, so it relied on memory — and a ship in this very session bumped only `plugin.json`, leaving `marketplace.json` stale at 1.34.3 until the user caught it. Fix moves the rule into the workflow that bypassed it.

## 1.35.0

- **agent-setup**: Templates and skill now seed two previously-missing high-value sections. The reviewer template gains a **"Known False Positives"** table (patterns that look wrong but are intentional — a reviewer needs them inline at zero-latency to *not* flag them) and the simplifier template gains **"Don't Simplify (Preserve These)"** (without it, a simplifier eventually collapses a deliberate guard). Also added multi-repo guidance for the sibling-repo case — when one session drives two repos whose agents don't both fire, the active agent carries a `⚠️ Two-repo session` banner, diffs both repos, and gets a second Bootstrap table + tagged sibling rules. Fixed a stale LSP step (`findReferences`/`goToDefinition` are often broken → use `hover` + `documentSymbol`). Steps 2/4/5 of the skill updated to cover all three. Caught while merging skill-depth into a project's agents and finding the templates couldn't express the false-positive list or the two-repo workflow.
- **update-claude-docs**: Step 6 (Agent Sync) rewritten from "agents read CLAUDE.md dynamically, no sync needed" to a **signal→agent routing table**. Default stays do-nothing (ordinary gotchas are picked up via Bootstrap — re-deriving agent tables would re-introduce the duplication the architecture avoids), but five agent-specific signals now route to a surgical agent edit: recurring false positive → reviewer's "Known False Positives"; wrongly-collapsed guard → "Don't Simplify"; new top-15 mistake → inline rules table; agent misbehavior → Process/Constraints; new sibling repo → two-repo banner. Structural changes still defer to `agent-setup`. Closes the gap where a false positive the reviewer kept flagging had no home but the agent file, which the skill never touched.

## 1.34.5

- **done**: Collapsed 5 steps to 4 (164→111 lines) — deleted the inline conversation-analysis procedure (old Step 3, sub-steps 3a–3d) that fully duplicated the `update-claude-docs` skill. Capture is now a single delegated Skill call, removing the "don't double-write" hedge that only existed to reconcile the two copies. `done` is now a pure orchestrator. Also wired the Output's User Instructions table to an explicit producer in the preamble (the slot previously had no step writing it). Caught when the workflow was flagged as bloated and an audit found the same capture logic written twice.
- **task-summary**: Added a top-level Density rules section to stop the #1 doc-bloat failure — the same fact restated across LLM-CONTEXT, Quick Start, Key Decisions, Gotchas, and Last Session. Rules: one-fact-one-home (sections point, don't restate), Gotcha/Decision rows ≤2 sentences, LLM-CONTEXT is a pointer index, Quick Start ≤15 lines. Strengthened `## Last Session` to enforce EXACTLY ONE such heading (it was being appended, producing duplicate dated copies). Fixes the generator so future docs stay dense rather than hand-trimming each one.

## 1.34.4

- **task-summary**: Read `references/templates.md` on every run, not just creation — the template (canonical section structure + gold-standard format) was only linked from the Create branch in §2/§3, so the Update path never loaded it and edits could drift from the template's conventions. §2 now reads both the resolved path and the template before the Create/Update fork. Caught when a "condense existing doc" request skipped the reference entirely because Update mode had no instruction to open it.

## 1.34.3

- **task-summary**: Reconcile back-references on update — index/roadmap/hub docs only *mirror* a feature's status and own no code, so the work-driven §1 scan never reaches them and their status drifts silently (a roadmap row reading "uncommitted" weeks after ship). New §6 step greps for docs that link back to the one just updated and status-syncs the mirrored row; §5 validation gains a check for it. Caught when a roadmap row still said "Implemented (uncommitted)" after the feature shipped to prod and only a manual "check all related" surfaced it.

## 1.34.2

- **read-summary**: Strengthen enforcement — add mandatory-first-action warning that blocks any query/edit/answer before the full Read Order completes; add explicit "Investigation / diagnostic" intent type (read-only questions like "is X paid by card?" or "why did Y fail?") to prevent premature answers

## 1.34.1

- **read-summary / update-claude-docs / task-summary**: Discover task docs by content, not folder name — folder slugs are engineer-domain-named and rarely match the request (`upload-redesign` owns "QC", `payout` owns "refund"). All three now `Glob`+`Grep` for the concept's vocabulary + synonyms across doc body + header, follow `Merged into`/`Supersedes` redirects, and verify a pointer's target exists before writing it. Prevents wrong-doc reads and duplicate docs.

## 1.34.0

- **pull-db**: New skill — transfer a MySQL/MariaDB database from a remote server to local dev environment; handles mysqldump on server, binary-safe scp transfer, MariaDB→MySQL FK compatibility fixes, password reset, and cleanup

## 1.33.0

- **done**: Enforce multi-domain task doc scan — removes single-path shortcut; task-summary always scans full conversation to avoid missed updates to related docs

## 1.32.0

- **done**: Multi-domain task doc updates — now scans all domains touched in session, not just the primary one; catches bug reports and feature requests mentioned across chat/email/WhatsApp
- **task-summary**: Multi-domain scan — when no explicit path given, scans full conversation (code changes, external inputs, verbal requests) and creates/updates a task doc per domain
- **gitnexus skills**: Add 6 new GitNexus skills — `gitnexus-cli`, `gitnexus-debugging`, `gitnexus-exploring`, `gitnexus-guide`, `gitnexus-impact-analysis`, `gitnexus-refactoring`
