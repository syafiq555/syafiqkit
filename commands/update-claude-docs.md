# Capture Session Knowledge

Extract reusable patterns from this session into CLAUDE.md files.

## 1. Scan — What happened?

Look for these signals in the conversation:

| Signal | Category |
|--------|----------|
| User correction ("not X, it's Y") | Gotcha or Convention |
| Claude struggled / repeated attempts | Gotcha |
| Claude ignored existing rule | **Violation** |
| Same pattern used 2+ times | Pattern |
| Environment surprise | Gotcha |
| Convention preference | Convention |
| Debugging root cause discovered | Gotcha |
| Team/strategy context | Context → `CLAUDE.local.md` |

For each signal, extract 2-3 keywords and **grep all CLAUDE.md files**:

| Grep result | Classification |
|-------------|---------------|
| No match | **New** — add entry |
| Match in correct file | **Violation** — must refine (see Step 3) |
| Match in wrong file | **Misplaced** — move to correct scope + refine |

## 2. Route — Where does it go?

Find the **most specific** CLAUDE.md (`Glob: **/CLAUDE.md` + check `CLAUDE.local.md`):

1. Personal/team context → `./CLAUDE.local.md` (project root)
2. Same domain as modified files → that domain's CLAUDE.md
3. Layer-level (`app/CLAUDE.md`, `resources/js/CLAUDE.md`)
4. Project root `CLAUDE.md`
5. Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**Read target first** — check structure, existing entries, where new entry fits.

## 3. Write — Hard rules

### New signals → Add entry

- Gotchas: `Symptom | Cause | Fix` table row
- Guidance: `❌ NEVER | ✅ ALWAYS` table row
- Patterns: Prose + code (reusable only)
- Pair every prohibition with an alternative ("don't X" needs "do Y instead")

### Violations → The rule needs more emphasis, not just clarity

A violated rule **always** needs an update — "the rule is clear" is not a valid reason to skip. Clear but violated = not prominent enough.

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Buried in a table? | Promote to `⚠️ MANDATORY` callout above the table |
| Not in active workflow? | Add as a numbered step in the workflow sequence |
| Too vague / too long? | Rewrite: one hard constraint beats five soft guidelines |
| Missing the "do Y" half? | Add the alternative action |

**Never** conclude "rule is clear, no update needed" for a violation.

### Constraints

- No duplicates across CLAUDE.md files
- Route to narrowest scope
- One refinement round per signal, then move on
- Use `Edit` tool (not `Write`)

## 4. Prune — Delegate to project agent

After Steps 1–3, check for a project-level pruning agent and delegate:

```
Glob: .claude/agents/claude-md-pruner.md
```

| Agent found? | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Yes | Launch `subagent_type: "claude-md-pruner"` with file paths to scan |
| No | Skip pruning — do not inline a pruning prompt |

**Agent prompt**: `Prune these CLAUDE.md files: [list paths]. Run in background.`

The agent has its own classification rules, litmus tests, and NEVER-delete safeguards. Do not override its instructions.

## 5. Validate

After writing each entry (in Step 3):
1. Re-grep keyword — confirm no duplicate created
2. Count `|` separators — must match table header
3. "Would removing this cause Claude to repeat the mistake?" — if no, delete it

**Task docs ≠ CLAUDE.md**: Feature-specific patterns stay in `tasks/**/current.md`. Only patterns that apply broadly go in CLAUDE.md.

## 6. Agent Sync

Agents read CLAUDE.md dynamically — no sync needed for gotchas. Only run `syafiqkit:agent-setup` if agent behavioral instructions change.
